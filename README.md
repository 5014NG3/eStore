# eStore
Simple eStore that allows you to search,checkout, and manage items that are sold by an arbitrary store. There is also a warehouse that keeps track of the 
different items that are provided to the store. The warehouse inventory is updated dynamically with each purchase of a customer or manager modifications to 
the stock. The data held in the store and warehouse are stored with a SQL database. Java is used to drive the actions of a customer or manager that purchases
items or modifies the stock levels and item descriptions of the store or warehouse
